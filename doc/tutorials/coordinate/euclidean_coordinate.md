# Euclidean Coordinate

Astronomy is a field which often deals with mathematics and especially when we are talking about the observations, geometry is used for keeping the data of the object's position.

In geometry Euclidean space has a really important part. It allows us to represent the position of a point or a vector. There are many different representations of it. (e.g: cartesian, cylindrical, spherical etc..)

All the representation classes use [boost::geometry::model::point](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_67_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/reference/models/model_point.html) as their underlying classes to store the component data. These representation classes are only wrappers around boost.geometry.

## Supported Representation in this library:
1. Cartesian Representation
2. Spherical Representation
3. Equatorial Representation

>**Note:** While using this library we insist you use Equatorial Representation only when you are using it for locations on earth with longitude and latitude.

To import all the representation, following is required:

```c++
#include <boost/astronomy/coordinate/representation.hpp>
```
